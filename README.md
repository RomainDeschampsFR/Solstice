# SOLSTICE
* Mod originaly made by WulfMarius, improved in many ways by JoeBuckley and now ressurected.
* It adds "seasons" into the game (Don't expect lush vegetation everywhere - it'll never happen...)
* Meaning the days are shorter and colder during winter, longer and warmer during summer.
* The greater the latitude, the longer the days in summer and the shorter in winter.
* **Not compatible with RELENTLESS NIGHT**.

### POLAR DAYS & POLAR NIGHTS
* Above 65Â° latitude you'll get polar days & polar nights during your run.
* Based on realistic values, here are the number of polar days/nights for each latitude (using a 365-day cycle as a reference)

Latitude	|	Polar days	|	Polar nights
-------	|	-------	|	-------
65	|	0	|	0
66	|	18	|	0
67	|	38	|	0
68	|	52	|	25
69	|	62	|	41
70	|	72	|	52
71	|	80	|	62
72	|	88	|	70
73	|	96	|	78
74	|	102	|	85
75	|	108	|	92
76	|	115	|	98
77	|	121	|	104
78	|	127	|	110
79	|	132	|	116
80	|	138	|	122


Meaning at latitude 72, you'll get every year, 88 polar days in a row and 70 polar nights in a row.

### TEMPERATURE
* The mod allows you to adjust the seasonal temperature gap if you want to (you can then keep vanilla temperatures which is already a challenge during winter)

### AURORA
* Every things related to the day/night cycle (temperature, lights, aurora, glimmer fog, ...) is therefore impacted.
* In the specific case of auroras, their frequencies are increased during equinoxes. In short, vanilla values during Winter/Summer, twice as much during Spring/Autumn.

## USEFUL MOD COMBO

* Extreme Drop Temperature (The Illusion) if you want to adjust or remove the vanilla temp drop over time
* Cozy Blankets (Jods) and Cozy Cushions (DZ) to get some more warmth bonus
* Bedroll Tweaker (Cass) to be able to stack bedroll warmth
* Darker Nights (Xpazeman) for an even harder experience during polar nights
* Wolf Comes Out at night (Cass) for a weir experience where summer is safer and winter more dangerous
* Clothing tweaker (Waltz) might be useful although a good balance between winter and summer will be hard to find
* Sun orientation fix (Cass), I need to have a look at it though)
* Probably many more... I let you judge.
